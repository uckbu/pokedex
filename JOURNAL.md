## 10/19/2025 - Created initial wildlife detector script  

Researched available and easy wildlife detection tools that are widely available, easy to run, and functional on lower-end edge devices (ideally something around the power of a Raspberry Pi 5).

Came to the conclusion that PytorchWildlife would be a sufficient workable solution and began researching how to write code that implements its wildlife detection with a PiCamera.

Wrote a second sample for my Mac to prove that it would be a functional implementation.
Backtracked and ended up running a docker container compiled by the PWL team.

But... unfortunately realized way too late that this only specified ANIMAL, and not the TYPE of animal...

Onto the next idea, I guess. Maybe a 3B VL LLM? I dislike wrappers.. but it could work on a pi with a high system memory, especially since we need some sort of universal animal detection that is very difficult to come by with models.

Ideally I will get a working prototype then train a series of my own YOLO models to move away from the LLM in the future.
